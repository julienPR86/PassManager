# PassManager
I named my project like this, cause the goal was to create in C a "pass manager", who's able to add, remove, get, passwords in a database. But keep in mind that is not safe ! And when a made it, i was thinking that it could be used for passwords, but it can also be used for other things ! It's just a little experiment from me.

## Requirements
Coming soon...

## Contributing
If you have suggest for my program, tell me, and I'll try to add them in my code ! This is a personnal project, I put it in public, but I'd like to be the only one who update it.
