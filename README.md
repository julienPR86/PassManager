# PassManager
I named my project like this, cause the goal was to create in C a "pass manager", who's able to add, remove, get, passwords in a database. But keep in mind that is not safe ! And when a made it, i was thinking that it could be used for passwords, but it can also be used for other things ! It's just a little experiment from me and i like to make projects like this.

## Requirements
If you've download the project, then you'll need a .txt file, named passwords.txt, which is in the same directory as the executable, where the data will be store.
```bash
touch passwords.txt
```
Then you just have to run the .exe file !
```bash
manager.exe
```

## Contributing
If you have suggest for my program, tell me, and I'll try to add them in my code ! This is a personnal project, I put it in public, but I'd like to be the only one who update it.
